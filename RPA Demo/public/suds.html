Bill Ludwig is a prolific singer/songwriter living in Manchester CT. He's been writing songs as far back as he can remember (the earliest he recalls the melody to ‘composed’ during a family car trip at the age of 7) and played in bands throughout high school. In 2013 he wrote and produced, “The Elephant”, a highly praised album of family friendly acoustic tunes. 2015’s Americana/folk/blues themed “Motivator”, showed his increasing breadth as a songwriter. In 2016, Bill recruited fellow musicians to perform on the first MARMO album, “A Week Of Mondays”, which was a departure from the solo performances of his earlier albums.

In 2016, Bill began performing more live shows, trying out new material on audiences for what would ultimately become his “One Hundred Miles Of Bad Road” album (partially a tribute to his father, who had recently sought help to deal with his experiences while serving in Vietnam), released in 2017.

In Summer 2017, Bill and Dan began their collaboration and became staples at Manchester's Spruce Street Market, and played at town venues like Silk City Coffee and the 2017 Silk City Music Festival.

Bill won Special Judge's Prize at the 2017 Farmington Valley Acoustic Festival for his song “Single Point (Another Shot) - a reaction to the tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada.
