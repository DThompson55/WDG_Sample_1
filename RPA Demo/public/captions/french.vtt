Dan Thompson here today we're going to talk about video

1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.530
transcription using Watson

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.710
API's. What is the Watson

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.060
speech to text API? Well it's

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.400
a set of API's

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.810
up in Bluemix that let you import audio

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.490
and export the text of that audio

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.970
with certain annotations. We're

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.140
going to import audio, Strip the audio

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.190
from the video and and

10
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.370
send the audio to Watson. Then we're

11
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.630
going to retrieve the annotated text from Watson.

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.940
We're gonna add some time stamps. We're

13
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.410
going to review the results, do

14
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.460
some error correction, and then

15
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.260
run things back through Watson again after retraining

16
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.390
Watson. And finally once we're done we

17
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540
will publish that video. Let's

18
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.830
see how this works. You

19
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.300
already know that Watson speech to text takes speech
