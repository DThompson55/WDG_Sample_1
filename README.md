"# WDG_sample1" 

This sample project reads an email from rpathompson55@gmail.com, looks for a pdf attachment, open it, and pulls values from its enclosed form. It then navigates to a web app and populates certain fields from those retrieved from the webform.

The web app requires node.js in order to run. But it is there in the RPA demo folder if you run the command

`node app.js`

The app will start up on port 6006. You can open a browser and try it out. It's jsut a test bed for RPA.  The RPA bot does not start the app, so you have to do that yourself first.

Then start wdg studio, load the email.wal file and run it.
